# Gradient Descent Visualizer - Requirements Analysis

## Project Overview
The Gradient Descent Visualizer is an educational web application that visualizes the iterations of the gradient descent algorithm across three types of functions:
1. Single variable real functions
2. Multivariate real functions
3. Complex functions with imaginary components

The project aims to help users better understand how gradient descent works, which is essential in various applications including position solving, machine learning, and optimization problems.

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Visualization of Gradient Descent Algorithm**
   - Visualize the step-by-step iterations of gradient descent
   - Show the path taken towards the minimum of a function
   - Display the gradient vector at each step
   - Allow users to see how the algorithm converges (or fails to converge)

2. **Support for Different Function Types**
   - Single variable real functions (1D → 1D)
   - Multivariate real functions (2D → 1D for visualization purposes)
   - Complex functions with imaginary components (visualization on complex plane)

3. **Interactive Controls**
   - Adjustable learning rate (α)
   - Customizable starting points
   - Ability to step through iterations manually or automatically
   - Option to change functions or input custom functions
   - Control over visualization speed

4. **Educational Components**
   - Explanations of gradient descent algorithm
   - Information about complex analysis and holomorphic functions
   - Visual representation of gradients and partial derivatives

### Technical Requirements
1. **Web-Based Implementation**
   - Accessible online through web browsers
   - Responsive design for different screen sizes
   - No installation required

2. **Performance**
   - Smooth animations and transitions
   - Efficient computation of gradients and function values
   - Real-time updates of visualizations

3. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**
   - Works on major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Technology Stack Considerations

### Frontend Framework
- React or Next.js for building the user interface
- Component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability

### Visualization Libraries
- Three.js for 3D visualizations (especially for complex functions)
- D3.js for data visualization and interactive elements
- Chart.js or Recharts for plotting functions and gradients

### Mathematical Libraries
- Math.js for mathematical operations and function parsing
- NumericJS or similar for numerical methods
- Custom implementation of gradient descent algorithm

### Styling
- Tailwind CSS for responsive design and styling
- CSS modules or styled-components for component-specific styling

## User Experience Considerations
- Intuitive interface with clear controls
- Visual feedback for algorithm progress
- Educational tooltips and explanations
- Smooth transitions between different visualizations
- Ability to save or share visualization results

## Development Approach
- Modular development of components
- Test-driven development for algorithm implementation
- Iterative approach to UI/UX design
- Continuous integration and deployment

## Deployment Strategy
- Deploy as a static website for optimal performance
- Consider using GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify for hosting
- Implement CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- Additional optimization algorithms (Newton's method, conjugate gradient, etc.)
- More complex function examples and case studies
- Performance optimizations for mobile devices
- User accounts to save custom functions and configurations
- Export functionality for educational purposes

This requirements analysis provides a foundation for developing the Gradient Descent Visualizer as an educational tool that works online and helps users understand the gradient descent algorithm across different types of functions.
