                                <p>Oct 2024 - Present | Golden, Colorado, United States (Hybrid)<br>A tech startup that combines my passions for mental/physical health with software development. I am working on a holistic web and mobile application that aims to maximize the intersecting concepts of well-being, fitness, online content consumption, diet, and one's outlook on life. I am using PyTorch, React Native, Node.js, Xcode, and more to develop this project for multiple platforms. Additionally, this application is designed around modern research citing Carol Dweck, Lisa Feldman Barrett, Anna Lembke, and more. The name "Coherascent" is derived from a portmanteau of "Coherent Ascension". This phrase refers to the company's mission of meaningfully climbing out of common societal health struggles. This startup also aims to help people of all backgrounds and strives to be non-partisan in its approaches. We are incorporating advanced mathematics and machine learning to provide personalized recommendations and predictive analytics, enhancing user experience and engagement.</p>

Applied SOLID software engineering principles, multivariable calculus, and concepts from probability and statistics. Built the UML structure of a C++ program from scratch in plantUML. Participated in a component of the project EdgGuide called the Autocalibration Tool. EdgGuide is a system that helps navigate blind or visually impaired people through public spaces like airports, aquariums, museums, etc. This system is composed of a Bluetooth Mesh Network, comprised of wall-mounted 'beacons' and 'tags' attached to the user. The purpose of our internship project, the Autocalibration Tool, was to vastly reduce installation costs by using Bluetooth technology to find distances between beacons, then applying position-solving algorithms (hill climb or gradient descent) to determine absolute positions in XYZ coordinates.</p>

                                <p>Nov 2023 - Present | Associated with Colorado School of Mines<br>A hobbyist project that visualizes iterations of the gradient descent algorithm with single and multivariate real functions, in addition to complex functions with an imaginary component. This algorithm is essential in a wide range of applications including position solving, machine learning, and more. Gradient descent takes steps to approach the relative minimum of a function with the approach xᵢ₊₁ = xᵢ - α▽fᵢ. (The upside-down triangle ▽ represents taking the gradient of a function, which is a series of partial derivatives of that function.) I was introduced to gradient descent in school (Introduction to Scientific Computing and Introduction to Machine Learning) and in my summer 2023 CACI Internship, so I wanted to better understand this algorithm since I know it is so widely used. I also wanted to self-study some Complex Analysis for fun, which is the study of calculus on the complex plane: Differentiable functions with an imaginary component are called holomorphic, and differentiability is checked from all directions instead of just the left and right in the context of real numbers.</p>

                                <h4>Generative AI-Enhanced Exploration of the Mandelbrot Set</h4>
                                <p>Dec 2021 - Present | Associated with Colorado School of Mines<br>I returned to this project in December 2023 to improve the visualization approach and to make the algorithm more efficient. Also, I decided to leverage generative AI to create novel visualizations and explore new fractal patterns inspired by the Mandelbrot set, combining the predictive capabilities of machine learning with the creative potential of generative models.  Created a representation of the famous fractal using custom inherited classes. Generates a working visual output. This project was developed in C++, and the concept of this fractal is based on the behavior of an equation on the complex mathematical plane: z₍ₙ₊₁₎ = zₙ² + c. 'c' represents the starting place on the complex plane, where the real and imaginary components correspond to horizontal and vertical axes respectively. The z-value is dependent on the iteration of the equation, and it initially starts with a value of zero. This equation will be iterated upon an arbitrarily large number of times, and it will either exceed, or stay within some pre-defined absolute value. A space on this fractal will either be blacked out or assigned a color depending on the rate of divergence of each location on the complex plane, based on the resolution of the output image.</p>
