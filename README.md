### Notes:
- **Customization**: Replace `yourusername/your-repo-name` with your actual GitHub repo details if you’re hosting this online.
- **Assets**: The README assumes the file structure matches your HTML (e.g., `css/`, `js/`, `images/`, `videos/`). Adjust paths if your setup differs.
- **Date**: I’ve set the "Last updated" to February 26, 2025, matching the current date you provided.

You can copy this text into a `README.md` file and tweak it to fit your needs. Let me know if you’d like adjustments!
