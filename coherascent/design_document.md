- Mood tracking with correlation to activities
- Behavioral activation exercises
- Mindfulness practice tracking
- Physical activity integration

### 2. Streak Functionality
- Daily streak tracking for each habit
- Visual representation of streaks
- Milestone achievements
- Recovery mechanics for missed days

### 3. Data Visualization
- Progress charts for each habit category
- Mood correlation with activities
- Streak history visualization
- Weekly and monthly summary reports

### 4. User Experience
- Simple onboarding process
- Daily reminders and notifications
- Personalized recommendations based on user patterns
- Educational content about CBT principles

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend (React/React Native)
- Component-based UI architecture
- State management with Redux
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Chart.js for data visualization
- Local storage for offline functionality

### Backend (Node.js)
- RESTful API endpoints
- User authentication (simplified for trial)
- Data persistence
- Synthetic data generation for demo purposes

### Data Model
- User profiles
